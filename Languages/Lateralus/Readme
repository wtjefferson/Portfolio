A custom data analysis language lexer implemented in C
					by William Jefferson

//////////////
// Overview
/////////////

LATERALUS is a unique programming language designed specifically for data analysis tasks. Its core functionality revolves around 
the use of maps and simplified loop constructs, making it highly efficient for handling and manipulating data sets. 
LATERALUS excels in scenarios where data organization, retrieval, and analysis are crucial. It simplifies these processes 
through its intuitive syntax and data structures, primarily focusing on maps (associative arrays) for storing and accessing data.

LATERALUS introduces a streamlined approach to loops with its spiral construct. These loops are easy to implement and ideal for 
iterating over data sets. The language also supports custom function definitions (parabol) for encapsulating reusable code, enhancing 
modularity in data processing scripts. Together, these features allow for writing concise and readable code, crucial for data analysis 
where complex operations are common.

LATERALUS is tailored for data analysts who require a tool that is both powerful and straightforward. Its design philosophy emphasizes 
ease of use without compromising on functionality, making it suitable for both simple and complex data analysis tasks. The language's 
focus on efficient data handling, coupled with its simplicity in looping and function definitions, makes it an ideal choice for 
processing, analyzing, and visualizing data.
